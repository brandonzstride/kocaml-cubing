  Purpose: perform necessary calculations before solving cubes.
  Compiles to: executable
  Status: not started.

  Detailed description:
    The user needs to have precomputed coordinate behaviors and
    pruning tables before running the solving algorithm, or else
    the solver will be extremely slow.

    This is an executable that performs all setup so that afterwards,
    the solver is ready to run.
