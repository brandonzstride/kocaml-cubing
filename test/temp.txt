original:
100101101100 is inverted properly
on f:
100100101000 is inverted properly
of f in coord:
110101100100

so UF accidentally gets flip
Df should be flipped but doesn't
FR accidentally gets flip
FL should get flipped but doesn't get flipped

I checked that when I do of and to perm, then move, then of and to perm again,
it's same as from move on coord.

So it might have to do with the order of ops and 

Issue seems to be that what gets flipped depends on where the piece is coming
from. I'm not sure how I can invert the correct cubies without knowing where
they are coming from. Maybe I have to do it first. But this goes against order
of ops. But in a cubie if I apply all the static stuff first (e.g. flipping some)
things, they'll come out flipped correctly.
